## Event

This is the 8th Rust Iran meetup and it's online due to the Covid-19
pandemic.

Bring your ideas, questions & projects:
- What did you work on this week?
- What problems did you solve this week with Rust?
- Are you just learning Rust and want some topic explained?
- Found an interesting crate you want to talk about?

Want to present something in the next meetup? mail me at kaveh at
riseup.net, we would be so happy to have you in the meetup.
